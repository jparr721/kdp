# kdp
Kafka Distributed Processing for Simplified Distributed Computing.

## Overview
KDP is a _pluggable_ distributed computing environment which uses libraries to distribute computing across multiple systems via message passing architectures. The main tenets of the system are the following: 
  - Consumers for individual processing
  - Libraries for individual processing of function pointers
  - Pre-baked systems for processing with function pointers with existing consuming servers
